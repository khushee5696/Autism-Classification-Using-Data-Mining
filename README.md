# Autism-Classification-Using-Data-Mining
The goal of the autism screening project is to establish a standardized method for diagnosing ASD and develop a reliable screening tool for autism in adults. 
Autism screening refers to the process of identifying the presence of Autism Spectrum
Disorder (ASD) in individuals. It has been a topic of great interest and research in the medical
field for a long time. The primary objective of developing an autism classification function is to
establish a reliable and standardized method for diagnosing ASD in individuals. By accurately
identifying autism, this classification function can contribute to the development of personalized
treatment strategies to address specific challenges associated with autism. To effectively
determine whether an individual has autism or not, the autism classification project focuses on
creating and evaluating classification models. These models include Multinomial Naive Bayes,
Random Forest Classifier, Decision Tree Classifier, and Logistic Regression. By utilizing these
models and analyzing the autism dataset, the project aims to develop a screening tool that is both
reliable and effective in diagnosing autism in adults. The research also seeks to enhance our
understanding of the disorder by exploring how these categorization models can be used to
identify subgroups within the autism spectrum.
